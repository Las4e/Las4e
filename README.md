# hi chat

###  I'm Talan, and I'm currently in my final year of Digital Game Design at SWCTA. However, in the near future, I don't have any plans to pursue it as a career, as I'm planning to enter the Computer Science field instead. This is because Game Design majors aren't avaliable in any colleges in the state I live in, so Computer Science is the next best option. 

### Currently, I'm working on a fun project where I replace every single texture and sound effect in Wii Sports. It sounds simple, but the process can be time consuming, especially when setting up certain things, such as the tools needed to replace said sound files.

### Thanks for stopping by!
